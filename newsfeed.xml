			<title>Release date dilemma!</title>
			<desc><p>So, this week on the forum. @Strite started off with voicing his opinion saying Bossa should push the release date back. This apparently struck a unexpected chord witht the forum memebers many people jumping in there with agreements. Then to mount it up @darkhog started a "counter-thread" saying that Bossa will actually give accessibility to the 11th of July (to line up with the art competition deadline), however with the competition pushed back to the 31st of July that theory was debunked, or was it? go discuss <a hreff="https://www.worldsadrift.com/forums/topic/when-bossa-will-release-worlds-adrift-and-why-its-most-likely-july-11th/">11th July Theory</a> and <a href="https://www.worldsadrift.com/forums/topic/delay-the-game/">Strite's thread</a>. Actually <span class="label label-warning">Luke Williams</span> jumped in and said that thats not happening, sorry guys. </p></desc>

				<p>For those players who missed it, this weeks favourite feature is: Player Spawning! Bossa said <a href="https://www.worldsadrift.com/forums/topic/spawn-points/#post-3301">here</a> that players will be spawned in regions deemed 'safe' from other players. Though it is good to note that this system won't be perfect and might end up in early game skirmishes.</p>

  	<p>
    Sky Drifter @Greenjuice has openly criticised the Armada's chronicler for his Creative Writing piece pointing out many grammatical flaws, The Armada have responded pointing out their Militaristic superiority in the situation. Nice move @Vick-Viper89
