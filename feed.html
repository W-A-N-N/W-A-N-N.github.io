			<strong>WANN: Update!</strong>
			<p>This will be one of the last of the techy updates posted here, I'll try to put more changelogs in commits in the github repo: <a href="https://github.com/W-A-N-N/W-A-N-N.github.io">LINK!</a> but we have semi-implemented a form for the WAAC and we're planning several more WA fan stuff!(e.g WASL, WART, WALN) Stay posted.</p>

			<title>Release date dilemma!</title>
			<p>So, this week on the forum. @Strite started off with voicing his opinion saying Bossa should push the release date back. This apparently struck a unexpected chord witht the forum memebers many people jumping in there with agreements. Then to mount it up @darkhog started a "counter-thread" saying that Bossa will actually give accessibility to the 11th of July (to line up with the art competition deadline), however with the competition pushed back to the 31st of July that theory was debunked, or was it? go discuss <a hreff="https://www.worldsadrift.com/forums/topic/when-bossa-will-release-worlds-adrift-and-why-its-most-likely-july-11th/">11th July Theory</a> and <a href="https://www.worldsadrift.com/forums/topic/delay-the-game/">Strite's thread</a>. Actually <span class="label label-warning">Luke Williams</span> jumped in and said that thats not happening, sorry guys. </p>
